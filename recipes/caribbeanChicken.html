        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat over to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>teaspoon of garlic salt, paprika, chili powder, 
                and nutmeg in a bowl until thoroughly combined. 
                Rub both sides of chicken breasts with the spice mixture, 
                and place into a 9x9-inch baking dish. 
                Sprinkle any remaining seasoning mix on top of chicken, if desired.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is lightly browned, 
                no longer pink inside, and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. 
                An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chicken breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Chop half the pineapple slices. Mix the chopped pineapple, cilantro, and olive oil into the cooked rice, and season to taste with a pinch or two of garlic salt and black pepper. Fluff the rice up with a fork, and transfer to a serving platter. Serve with the baked chicken, topped with remaining pineapple slices.</li>
