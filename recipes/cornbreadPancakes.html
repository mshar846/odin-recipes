         <!--unordered list of ingredients-->
         <h5>Strawberry syrup</h5>
         <li>1 pound fresh strawberries</li>
         <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
         <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
         <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
         <h5>Cornbread Pancakes</h5>
         <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
         <li>1 3/4 cups buttermilk</li>
         <li>1 1/4 cups cornmeal</li>
         <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
         <li>2 large eggs</li>
         <h3><p>Steps</p></h3>
         <!--ordered lists for steps-->
         <ol>
           <li>Place strawberries in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in sugar, water, and lemon juice and bring to a simmer. Lower heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until strawberries are very soft, and the syrup starts to thicken, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>  
           <li>Remove from the stove and carefully pass through a mesh sieve into a bowl. Discard any seeds and fibrous bits that are left in the sieve. Let syrup cool for 15 minutes, then cover and store in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
           <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until all ingredients are well incorporated; set aside.</li>
           <li>Place buttermilk, cornmeal, and 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir with a whisk until butter melts and mixture starts to simmer. Once simmering, cook and stir until very thick, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 minutes.</li>
           <li>Whisk eggs into the cooled cornmeal mixture until incorporated. Add the reserved flour mixture and stir with a spatula until well combined and no flour remains in the saucepan; batter will be thick but still scoopable.</li>
           <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, scoop 1/3 cup batter for each pancake into the hot skillet and press them down with the back of a spatula to flatten out. Cook until the outside edges start to look a little dry, about 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side until pancakes are cooked through, another 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat to cook remaining pancakes, adding more butter to the skillet as necessary.</li>
           <li>Top warm pancakes with strawberry syrup</li>
        </ol>
